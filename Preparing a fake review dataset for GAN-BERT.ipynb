    "Through this notebook the dataset used by the recently published paper 'Creating and detecting fake reviews of online products' will be prepared to be used by GAN-BERT. Since GAN-BERT required unlabeled, labeled, and a test dataset, the dataset will be divided into three seperate datasets. Additionally, the datasets are cleaned, formatted, and later on exported as csv files to meet the requirements for GAN-BERT.\n",
