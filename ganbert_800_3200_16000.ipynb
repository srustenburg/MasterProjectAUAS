       " ('Review of:  \"What Paul Meant\"  By: Garry Wills  Paul was the first letter writer of Christianity.  His epistles are considered the most pessimistic writings of the early church.  Despite the pessimism of Paul\\'s epistles, he guided the early church and aided the growth of the early church.  The author, Garry Wills, calls the growth of the early church an explosion of belief.  He says of Paul:  \"Paul was part of this explosion of belief.\"  Garry Wills says that Nietzsche called Paul the \"dysangelist\" or the bad news bearer, and \"a man with a genius for hatred.\"  This is in contrast to Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, the \"evangelists\" or the good news bearers.  The author asks the question: \"how much of this notoriety is deserved?\"  His answer: \"very little.\"  This book uses seven of Paul\\'s letters: \"Letter to the Thessalonians\", \"Letter to the Galatians\", \"Letter to the Philippians\", \"Letter to Philemon\", \"First Letter to the Corinthians\", \"Second Letter to the Corinthians\" and \"Letter to the Romans.\"  These are the letters whose authorship is not disputed.  Author Wills shows that Paul echoed and amplified the message of love spoken by Jesus.  Paul had the same message of love as Matthew, Mark, Luke and John when he reports on the teaching of Jesus.  This book also gives details of the life of Paul and of the history of early Christianity.

In Everyday Zen, the author makes it a point to communicate in plain English.  Sometimes this is done using little stories, sometimes by sharing some experiences, and sometimes in the form of dialogues the author has had with Zen students.  What I found most valuable is that, because of these explanations I could clearly see how the zen philosophy could directly affect my life.

(Especially in consideration of a few outstanding faults)  The most annoying aspect of this particular product was that it was not a very precise fit whatsoever. The Kindle Touch uses a good deal of perimeter screen area for display, which makes having nearly one centimeter clearance on each side of a centered screen protector application extremely annoying and difficult to overlook. If they were perfectly clear, it may be a little easier for others to overlook, but the translucence is ever so slightly different than the screen itself. I removed my screen protector immediately after application.  I must note that I often and gladly employ the use of screen protectors whenever reasonably applicable, particularly with touch screen cell phones, but when it comes to the Kindle Touch I\\'m not too sure if they truly serve any degree of necessary function at all. With most book-like e-reader covers (mine being the standard \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Amazon-Kindle-Touch-Leather-Cover-Black/dp/B004SD22PQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Amazon Kindle Touch Leather Cover, Black</a>\" - of which I am EXTREMELY happy with), the only time the screen is actually exposed would be when the Kindle is in use. In this case, the annoyance of a poorly fitting screen protector doesn\\'t come close to outweighing the slim risk of anything happening to the screen in conjunction with a proper cover and/or case.  In summation: If you find that you need a screen protector and don\\'t mind that it only covers 95% of the screen, then this product should certainly suffice - 3 stars for the sake of advertised purpose fulfillment.',\n",

In the sixth grade, he played Jesus in the Easter Passion play at his Catholic school and was on the cross.

When he notices and is instantly taken with the gorgeous blonde and realizes she is going to be auctioned off, he sets a plan in motion and is the highest bidder.  Hes in town for a week, so why not make the best of it! And, oh my, what these two go through in this one week is full of ups and downs, love and confusion, misunderstandings and conflicts.  I really felt for Riley.  His struggles with his addiction, wanting to just be accepted by his parents, his mothers meddling and the ultimatum! I loved the way Erin backed him up and stood up for him at the barbeque.  Oh and the serenade...**swoon** How can you not love him!! Great addition to the Tangled Web series!

So here is a basic pro/con list:  Pros: -The drill/screwdriver actually works to spin the screws down and then has a reverse feature to pull them up.  It looks so similar to an actual drill/screwdriver that my daughter thinks hers is just like daddy\\'s.  It is really neat how it works with the screws and the holes.  -The hammer and wrench work great with the \"nails\" and are great toys for my baby to hold and chew on.  -The interactive features are wonderful, they are very engaging and the little \"project\" cards are really cute.  I like the ones that have colors and numbers.  -The box itself is very sturdy, you can pull the top piece up and store tools underneath.  It is very well made.  Cons:  -The drill/screwdriver doesn\\'t fit in the tool box for storing when not playing.  This makes no sense to me and I try to keep them together but I am sure my children will inevitably not store them near each other and we will misplace the drill/screwdriver piece.  -I love the project cards, however, the one card has 9 holes (which has numbers 1-9 on one side and colors on the other side), however, you only get 2 screws and 2 nails with the kit.  So my 2 year old keeps telling me that screws are missing because there is not one for each hole in the tool box, which you don\\'t notice with the 4 hole card on top but you do with the 9 hole card.  So then she gets upset trying to find them thinking she has lost them.  I would love to see one screw in each color with a number on it and then you could work on matching the correct screw to the corresponding hole with the color/number card inserted - that would be a neat educational feature and then you would have enough screws for every hole.',\n",

       " (\"A romantic mystery with a touch of suspense.  An Opportunity Seized caught my attention with its name. I immediately thought that this was a workplace/office mystery. After reading the book I am still not sure what the title has to do with the story.  Toni is an heiress, the daughter of a mining magnate, who just wants to be normal whereas Jason is ex-military and co-owner of Haven Security. Jason is the bodyguard hired by Tonis father.  While guarding her he develops feelings for her. She falls for him, too. A relationship that was almost impossible to begin with is tested when a mining accident threatens the whole family.  One thing I liked about the relationship was that though both of them were immensely attracted to each other, they also get to know each other on a deeper level than just chemistry. This part of their relationship is shown clearly after the mining accident.  Readers who enjoy frequent sex will be pleased with this short story. It wasn't the hard core erotic variety but there is enough to make a reader who isn't used to reading it to possibly become either uncomfortable or start blushing like crazy.  That being said this is still a mystery. I think the beginning was a little slower than the ending. The ending seemed a little fast paced, which I loved.  This is a romantic mystery, heavy on the sexual elements. It worked for me because there was enough of the mystery plot to offset some of the romance.  The ending was a full of surprises. The twists and turns and the new information that were revealed kept me reading to the very end.  originally posted at long and short reviews\",\n",

Did not want to buy into a proprietary soda-making system, but that seemed the only option till I chanced on a review of the Mastrad Purefizz. From the design and operation of the Purefizz to the fact that the chargers are recyclable, this is a winner. It arrived today, right on schedule. On my first attempt, I made two yummy egg creams using the chocolate syrup recipe Rachel Meeks provides on her small notebook dot org site. She credits Amy D of The Complete Tightwad Gazette for the recipe.  Though I ordered from Mastrad, I thank Amazon and the previous product reviewers who convinced me to get this gem.  Updated 041715: Can I add a star? I made seltzer water a few weeks ago and forgot about it in the fridge. Opened the Mastrad last night and poured a lovely glass of fizzy water. One more this morning. Surely didn't expect the bubbles to last so long - and I'm not counting on this happening again. After seeing reviews about rust at the bottom and metallic taste: I've had this nearly a year and keep it, full or empty, in the fridge. It's great. Keeping the Purefizz and the water very cold prior to use and in between uses has worked well. I use the pressurized top when returning the Purefizz to the fridge, where it stays unless it's making a new batch of seltzer. And it never goes in the dishwasher.\",\n",

This box cutter wouldn't be so bad if it had any kind of edge on it. I'm not talking shaving here I just mean an EDGE! I have sharper butter knives. It still cuts through packing tape but going through cardboard ain't so easy. This thing has an auto retracting blade. It requires constant tension with your thumb to hold the blade out while trying to hold onto the cutter. This in combination with the dull blade makes cutting though tougher materials harder than it needs to be. If they had just sharpened it a little bit more it would work so much better. The magnet is a nice touch and makes it more accessible. Still, I'll stick with my metal blade box cutter and just be careful. Another thing to keep in mind, ceramic blades are harder than metal blades but that means they are more brittle too. Put too much sideways pressure on this blade and it will break like a clay pot .It can't be returned! No Dilly! UPDATE: I was too harsh with my review of this little dude. After using it more I've change my mind about one thing. It does exactly what it is designed to do. Open packages and boxes. All of my earlier criticisms were warranted. It sucks at cutting up cardboard. The retractable blade while being a valid saftey feature is still a pain. Maybe it will wear in after more use. The cerramic blade could be sharper but it suffices for cutting packing tape and soft packaging. But I am also glad it was unreturnable. This forced me to use it more and see it's value.

       " (\"When the story begins, we are in the mind of Elsie, a smart, funny and sarcastic if a bit average teenager. Elsie and her sister, Julie, (Elizabeth and Jane Bennet) who is one year older than she are have moved from their home in Massachusetts and are going to a new prep school called Coral Tree. There, they meet Chase and Chelsea Baldwin (a.k.a. Charles and  Caroline Bingley) and Chase's friend, Derek Edwards (Will Darcy), a handsome, guy who happens to have famous parents. Elsie immediately pegs him as a rich jerk, with girls fawning over him and guys wanting to be him. She also makes friends with Webster Grant, a clever funny guy who, for some reason Derek hates. As the story unfolds, you learn the stories between why Derek is so sheltered, why he hates Webster, and who he really is. This was the best remake of Pride and Prejudice I have ever read, it is true to the story but, still not predictable and leaves you anticipating the characters actions.  Lazebnik did not just take Elizabeth and Will, rename them, and stick them in a modern-day high school, she molded and tweaked them, but only slightly, to fit the setting and story. I still love/like Elizabeth, Jane, Darcy, Georgia and Mr. Benton, still am annoyed by Lydia and Mrs. Benton, and still despise Caroline (Does not have Mr. Collins).  There is some romance and cussing, but nothing very bad. I really enjoyed this book and loved watching Elsie and Derek grow as characters until the very end. This was so good, I truly encourage you to pick this up and start reading.\",\n",

I should also mention the metal armrests were both labeled \"J\" (instructions called one \"I\" and one \"J\") and took me awhile to figure out which is which, genius that I am.  The upholstery is a textured brownish-grey, with the metal frame kind of somewhere between a gold/nickel color.... I would think it\\'d be important to know this going in if your color scheme is important.  For me, the question of whether this chair is worth the $ is its longevity.  Will the upholstery pull or tear easily?  Will the up/down mechanism last?  Etc.  If I think of it I will check in here with an update in 6 months.

Yes he had many misogynistic jokes at the time, but I separate this movie from his comedy; I mean, he takes care of a koala bear in the movie, how mean could he be?  The movie is about his character Ford Fairlane, a rockabilly style detective who works on cases for rock stars.  The only problem is most of his clients pay him in things other than money, such as guitars, sex, etc...  He comes across a case that involves finding 3 different cds or something like that.  I mean, they actually tried to put a plot in this movie, but you could have had a movie alone with just the main characters antics.  In a classic scene, Ford wakes up with two women in his bed and as the women start to leave he pleasingly begs them, \"hey girls, make breakfast, do my laundry\"; classic stuff.  Eventually, Wayne Newton shows up as the bad guy and we are treated to scenes of Ford Fairlane making witty remarks towards Wayne Newton\\'s character(Julien Grendel).  If you want to brush up on classic 90s films or just a decent comedy in general, check this one out.

The build quality is pretty good  the containers are thick enough that they don't bend or rack if you twist it which gives me confidence that they will stand up to a good amount of use (and abuse). The lids are thinner, but still of good quality. The lids snap on with a firm snap so you know it is sealed. I am, however, concerned about the longevity of the lid snaps since they are all-plastic with just a crease line to serve as the hinge.  I filled one with various items and gave it a torture test to see how it would stand up. The lid remained firmly attached even after I dropped it several times from desk height to a tile floor, and tossed it around while it was in a laptop bag (in other words, a normal usage pattern for people such as myself who have a tendency to drop things often). No cracks or splits in the plastic either.  It is sized more for a kids-size meal than an adult. The overall dimensions are fine, but you cant fill up the compartments to the top of the lid with items such as pasta since the partitions do not extend to the top  they only extend up about 1.25 inches. That puts a limit on how much you can fill each compartment (provided, of course, that you want the food to remain contained in each compartment).  On the plus side, they are very attractive. The base is crystal clear and the lids (which come in four colors) are transparent. It would look just fine for both a school lunch or an office lunch.

It is several inches more narrow than husband\\'s bag (but also lighter). 2. The zippers at the base corner of the bag seem to be two different zippers that leave a little gap.

Thanks to their Vikings ships, they covered great geographical areas by crossing oceans and sailing up river routes. Sure they were ferocious warriors to start with when exploring new lands, but they loved peace and harmony as well as evidenced by their successful integration with natives through matrimony, conversion to Christianity, peaceful trading and adopting local customs and assuming local names.  Thanks to archeology and artefacts scattered in all the lands they covered, we know today they were so well integrated in the lands they ventured to that their graves intermingled with the graves of the natives.

If I went to their site each time and used their web extention. No option to download the app to make Skype just one click away. The same happened when I wanted to get a torrent downloader. None work with chromebook, and extentions that might have were a hassle to figure out. I didn't have a fresh goat or virgin to sacrifice on hand to make this task seamless. Not being able to download popular apps for all of my favorite things was the ultimate deal breaker for me.

The overriding conceit at the heart of `Bad Teacher' is the idea that the audience will somehow look past the reprehensible moral bankruptcy at the core of the central character (played to perfection by Cameron Diaz) and root for her, because she's good looking and has a few memorable one-liners so all can be forgiven. The character Diaz plays so well is dishonest, greedy, lazy, irresponsible, rude, utterly self-serving and in every way despicable. She is educating your kids, folks, and her manipulative, blackmailing ways win out for her in the end. This is funny, OK?  The film gets two stars rather than one because, on a purely technical level, it works as a (very improbable) narrative. The storyline is coherent and the editing snappy, the actors give their all, the script does have its moments, it's watchable. But somehow it's hard to get past the overall message the film leaves you with: if you're a selfish, lying, morally bankrupt, pot-smoking, drunken, money-grubbing whore willing to blackmail and deceive all around you whilst having complete contempt for any kind of professional responsibility to your students and their futures, this is in some way admirable.

He loved her with all his heart and protected her to the point she could do nothing a normal teenager and young adult should have experienced at her age, he was frightened of anyone getting to her and using her as a bargaining chip or worse against his life and to take his control and power.

The overall build quality looks a bit nicer on the Citiz than the Essenza but I\\'ve only used it for almost two months so I can\\'t comment on reliability but no problems yet.  - The Citiz + milk has a significant larger footprint than the compact c100. However, it does integrate the frother using one plug which is a bonus.  - The folding pedastal cup holder on the Citiz is great for my larger mugs which I had to alway tilt and hold on the Essenza which was a major annoyance.  - The new Aerocinno is amazing ... a much better improvement over the older non-plus version and worth the extra money. The foam taste is a whole lot better as far as texture goes. The only thing is that it no longer uses a clever magnetic lid to keep the extra attachment.  - Overall, the Citiz amd Essenza are equally as good as the espresso taste great with both. I could recommend the Essenza for the cheaper price, in my case track proven reliability, a smaller footprint since the Aerocinno is separate and can be stored away.

When wall mounted or pushed up against the wall the sound sounds tinny like how your cellphone speaker sounds when placed speaker down on a table. When the tv is on a tv stand one foot from the wall it has great, clear very loud sound that is more than adequate for my use. That being said a external subwoofer and/or sound bar would be advisable for anyone who likes a lot of extra \"BASS\"  I love the power button on this tv!

I'll admit that I was tempted to skip through the stories that I'd read previously, but I'm glad that I didn't. The short stories provided different snap shots of the world the author has created and while they were excellwent reads in their own right, they are so much better when re-read with the wider context this book provides.  The overall story is great, the different glimpses tantilise with what is going on before drawing together into a conclusion that both feels logical and satisfies. It's also open to allow further books in the series which I hope is the intent.

Each turn players place their workers on a variety of different spaces that discover and populate parts of the \"New World\", collect trade goods, specialist workers, and battle opponents.  It can be compared to Dominant Species where worker placement is also used to manage the area control mechanics of a game.  I didn\\'t really care for that game and I don\\'t like this one much better.  I do like it a little better because it doesn\\'t seem as abstract as Dominant Species.

I think I just need to stop playing these older games so long after their release because I tend not to like them with a few exceptions.  Worker placement has been refined so much and knocked out of the park by so many games since this came out that this game just seems kind of bland and samey even if it was original at the time it was released.  Even the mechanic I labeled as \"slightly original\" where you can acquire different kinds of workers with special abilities has been done and done better by several other games since.  All in all this game was simply bland.  The worker placement piece, which with how much I like worker placement should have been my favorite piece, just seemed ancillary and unnecessary to the area control piece.

There is an overheat circuit interrupt with a button on the back of the unit, and sensitive tip over cut-off switch.  Very pleased with the safety of the unit overall.  The unit functions in two ways, first is the reflective heat you can see and feel when the unit is ON; it feels like warm sunshine.

I have used a variety of these little class d type amps over the years to drive aux sound in spare rooms, garage and the like.  Most all of these amps were good for what I used the, for but just did not have that clarity nor reserve power needed to get truly good sound out of them.  After a while I would find all of them just okay but not amazing like I had hoped. now granted I realize these are inexpensive little amps and I can not or should not compare them with say a Rotel, Yamaha or Harmon kardon so that is not what I am looking for.  But I do like to have nice clean sound with a lil bass at times.  When we needed something extra to go with the sound bar connected to our main tv I just did not want to go all home theater on the set up - it is just too expensive, too bulky and too power hungry.  What I wanted was to drive my Polk bookshelf speakers with the 3.5 mm jack off my tv which would work with my volume control also.  Did some searching and came across this sweet little mama jama and figured why not - if I don't like it I send it back, right?  Well wow is all we can say.  Got this in a jiffy, hooked it up and connected my polks.  This sucker sounds amazing - crystal clear highs and nice rumbly lows are coming across consistently without any sign of distortion or excess heat being generated by the amp.  Do not hesitate - grab one of these units now before they realize it should be priced higher!!\",\n",

I found a few online forums that had the same issue. I checked to make sure it was level, there were no holes, and it wasn't over full.  Well it filled up right to the brim, but it was leaking from the flimsy reserve add on tank. I ended up removing it but it was still leaking a little.

Stars Christopher George as the park ranger , Richard Jaeckel as a naturalist and Andrew Prine as a vietnam vet running a helicopter service.

I originally rated this blender at 3 stars earlier today and have now changed my rating to 1 star after using the blender a second time - after using it extremely lightly twice it cracked near the blade (see the product picture I've uploaded).  I was blending liquids so I can't imagine this thing surviving crushing things as the description states.  If you're smart you'll avoid this blender and pay a few more dollars for one that's more durable.  Original review: This is a nice basic hand/stick blender.  The price was right for what I needed it for - purchased for soap making so I didn't want to spend a ton of money on it.  That being said, I'll probably look for a different one the next time around because this one ended up being bigger and more awkward than I was expecting and I have large hands (if I had smaller hands I definitely wouldn't like using it).  The end with the blade detaches for cleaning which is nice but the blade assembly itself doesn't.

Fortunately for me It decreased that time by a couple seconds and made a HUGE improvement in handling and overall stability of the boat at speed. While running this stabilizer, the boat seems to glide straight through rough lake chop and wake like it never has before. It made my boat sit noticeably higher on plane which is probably the reason it ran through wake easier. I also noticed the handling seemed much more stable at all speeds and I could hold plane 5 mph slower than I could before.
